# C# Mini Project

This repository includes a number of C# programs that illustrate various ideas and features.

## Programs

1. **Arithmetic Operations**

    **Perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and square root.**

   (a) An arithmetic operation is specified by combining operands with one arithmetic operator.
   
   (b) Arithmetic operations can also be specified by the ADD, SUBTRACT, DIVIDE,and MULTIPLY built-in functions.
   
   (c) The plus sign and the minus sign can appear as prefix operators or as infix operators.

2. **Armstrong Numbers**
   
    **Find Armstrong numbers in a given range.**
   
   (a )Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits.

   (b) For example 0, 1, 153, 370, 371 and 407 are the Armstrong numbers.

   (c)**407** = (4*4*4) + (0*0*0) + (7*7*7)

         Here, multiply each number three times as shown below:

         (4*4*4) = 64

         (0*0*0) = 0

         (7*7*7) = 343

         Therefore, add the above-multiplied numbers, you will get the result as written below:

         64+0+343 =407

4. **Substring of Strings**
   
   **Find all substrings of a given string.**

   (a) A substring is a subset or part of another string, or it is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

   (b) In C#, IndexOf() method is a string method.

   (c) This method is used to find the zero-based index of the first occurrence of a specified character or string within the current instance of the string.
   
   
 *********************************************************************************************************************************************
4. **Divide By Zero Exception**
   
    **Handle DivideByZeroException in C#.**

   (a) Trying to divide an integer or Decimal number by zero throws a DivideByZeroException exception.

   (b) To prevent the exception, ensure that the denominator in a division operation with integer or Decimal values is non-zero.
   
   (c)It indicates that a statement attempted to evaluate a division by zero.

5. **Pascal's Triangle**
   
   **Print Pascal's Triangle pattern.**

   (a) A Pascal Triangle is a triangle of numbers where each number is the two numbers directly above it added together in the previous row.

   (b) example:

      1
   
      1 1
   
      1 2 1
   
      1 3 3 1
   
      1 4 6 4 1
   
      1 5 10 10 5 1
   
      1 6 15 20 15 6 1
   

 *********************************************************************************************************************************************
6. **Floyd's Triangle**

   **Print Floyd's Triangle pattern.**

  (a)  Floydâ€™s Triangle is a triangular array of natural numbers named after Robert Floyd, who was an American computer scientist.
  
  (b) It is a right-angled triangular array of natural numbers, where the first row contains a single number 1, the second row contains two numbers 2 and 3, the 
      third row contains three numbers 4, 5 and 6, and so on. 

  (c) example:

       1
       
       2  3
       
       4  5  6
       
       7  8  9 10
       
       11 12 13 14 15

7. **Read and Copy a Text File**

   Read and copy the contents of a text file.
   

 ****************************************************************************************************************************************************************
8. **Implementation of Stack Operations**

   **Implement basic stack operations like push, pop, peek, and display.**

   (a) Stack represents a last-in, first out collection of object. It is used when you need a last-in, first-out access to items.

   (b) When you add an item in the list, it is called pushing the item and when you remove it, it is called popping the item. This class comes under System. 
    
   (c)The following are the basic operations served by stacks.
   
       push : Adds an element to the top of the stack.

       pop : Removes the topmost element from the stack.

       isEmpty : Checks whether the stack is empty.
   

 *****************************************************************************************************************************************************************
9. **Complex Numbers**

   **Perform arithmetic operations on complex numbers.**

    (a) A complex number is a number in the form a + b * i where a and b are real and i satisfies i^2 = -1 . a is called the real part and b is called the 
        imaginary part of z .

    (b) example :A complex number like 7+5i is formed up of two parts, a real part 7, and an imaginary part 5. Here, the imaginary part is the multiple of i.

10. **Polymorphism Concepts**
   
    **Demonstrate polymorphism concepts using shapes.**
    
     (a) Polymorphism is one of the features provided by Object Oriented Programming.

     (b) Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.
    

 *********************************************************************************************************************************************
11. **Abstract Class for Calculating the Perimeter**

    **Use abstract classes to calculate the perimeter of shapes.**

   (a)  Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).
   
   (b) Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the derived class (inherited from).

   (c) To find the perimeter of a shape, you add up the lengths of all the sides. For a square or pentagon, it's even easier - you can multiply the length of one 
       side by the number of sides to get the total perimeter.

12. **Interface for Resizable**

  Implement an interface for resizing rectangles.
